     <h3>About Me</h3>
     <p>I am Abdu, and I'm based in Manchester. 
        I'm currently working on different projects in the online market,
         I have a PPL (Private Pilot Licence) so I've been flying for some time.</p>
     <p>I liked the idea of coding and software development when I watched a couple of vloggers online 
        showing their work and how they go on through their daily life as coders and how the
         whole community work together, and what really made me want to join this community
        is when one of my close friends joined a coding bootcamp, and after finishing the
        course he got a good offer for a job as a Junior Full Stack Developer at a tech
        company, so I'm excited to become a software developer and join this community
        and deal with latest technology, as it helps us work through our daily activities,
        and keep working on advancing and going forward to make us become more productive and efficient in our lives.</p>
